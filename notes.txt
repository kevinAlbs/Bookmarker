Notes:
- PHP does not allow a child class to have more restrictive constructor visibility. Java allows this for constructors but not methods (because you can polymorphically call the method of a parent class, thus overriding the more restrictive visibility. Does this imply that you can call a constructor of a parent polymorphically?)
